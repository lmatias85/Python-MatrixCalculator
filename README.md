# **Matrix Calculator**

## **Overview**
>The purpose of the application is to calculate matrices operations.
You will be able to do:

* Sum between matrices.    
* Multiplication between a matrix and a scalar.
* Multiplication between matrices.
* Transpose of a matrix.
* Calculate the determinant of a matrix.
* Get the adjugate matrix of another one.
* Get the inverse matrix of another one.
* Choose and get the rows of a matrix.
* Choose and get the columns of a matrix.
* Get a sub matrix of another one.

### **Resolution**
>There are two ways to get the **Matrix Calculator**

**1. Interface Application:** there is a class named MatrixCalculator which has static methods that can be called to do
the matrices operations you need. You just need to call the operations and send the parameters.   

**2. Multi options Application:** you can execute the file named **main.py**. An option menu will be shawn were you can 
select the operation to execute. You will be asked to insert the data operation.


### **Unit tests**
>There are 20 test cases that you can verify executing the script **matrix_calculator_test.py**. None of the exceptions 
responses were tested.
